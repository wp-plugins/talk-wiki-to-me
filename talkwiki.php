Notes:
    This comes with big thanks to the  Better-Wiki-Links plugin.  That I have
    augmented here to provide functionality of multiply wiki-like linking in
    the hopes that it saves individuals the time and the trouble of having
    to define their links will writing and article while also allowing a level
    of abstraction that will hopefully prevent the tragic consequences of a
    simple URL change of a service or a site that is being used to link.
